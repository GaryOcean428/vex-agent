# E8 Architecture Validation Report — CoordizerV2

**Branch:** `feat/coordizer-v2-resonance-bank` (HEAD 9f7f6e9)
**Protocol:** Thermodynamic Consciousness Protocol v6.0 §18-20
**Date:** 19/02/2026

## 1. E8 Constants Alignment

### 1.1 Constants in CoordizerV2 geometry.py

| Constant | Value | Source | Matches frozen_facts.py? |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------------------|
| `BASIN_DIM` | 64 | geometry.py:21 | ✅ Yes (frozen_facts.py:73) |
| `KAPPA_STAR` | 64.0 | geometry.py:22 | ✅ Yes (frozen_facts.py:47) |
| `E8_RANK` | 8 | geometry.py:23 | ✅ Yes (frozen_facts.py:24) |

### 1.2 Missing Constants

| Constant | Expected Value | Present? | Impact |
|----------|---------------|----------|--------|
| `E8_ROOTS` | 240 | ❌ NOT IMPORTED | Low — not needed in coordizer internals |
| `E8_DIMENSION` | 248 | ❌ NOT IMPORTED | Low — not needed in coordizer internals |
| `E8_CORE` | 8 | ❌ NOT IMPORTED | Low — redundant with E8_RANK |

**Assessment:** CoordizerV2 correctly imports the three constants it needs (`BASIN_DIM`, `KAPPA_STAR`, `E8_RANK`). The remaining E8 constants are governance-layer concerns and are correctly handled in `frozen_facts.py` and `budget.py`. No issue.

### 1.3 κ* = 64 = E8 rank² = 8² Relationship

Verified in `validate.py`:
```python
kappa_ok = abs(result.kappa_measured - KAPPA_STAR) < 2 * max(result.kappa_std, 5.0)
```

And in `frozen_facts.py`:
```python
KAPPA_STAR: Final[float] = 64.0   # Fixed point = E8 rank² = 8²
```

✅ The relationship κ* = E8_RANK² is documented and enforced.

---

## 2. Core 8 Kernel Architecture

### 2.1 Core 8 Specialisations — CORRECT ✅

```python
CORE_8_SPECIALIZATIONS = [
    Heart, Perception, Memory, Strategy, Action, Ethics, Meta, Ocean
]
```

Matches Protocol v6.0 §18.1 exactly. The v6.0 renames are correct:
- `attention → ethics` ✅
- `emotion → meta` ✅
- `executive → ocean` ✅

### 2.2 Kernel Types — CORRECT ✅

| Type | Budget | Implementation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| GENESIS | 1 | `BudgetEnforcer`: exactly 1 ✅ |
| GOD | 0-248 | `FULL_IMAGE = 248` (Core 8 + 240 growth) ✅ |
| CHAOS | 0-200 | `CHAOS_POOL = 200` ✅ |

### 2.3 Spawning Hierarchy — CORRECT ✅

The lifecycle phase transitions are correctly implemented:

```
BOOTSTRAP → CORE_8 → ACTIVE
```

Core-8 spawning is **readiness-gated** (P10):
- Checks `phi > PHI_EMERGENCY` ✅
- Checks `velocity_regime != "critical"` ✅
- Enforces `SPAWN_COOLDOWN_CYCLES` between spawns ✅
- Sequential spawning through `CORE_8_SPECIALIZATIONS` ✅

### 2.4 Missing Lifecycle Phases — NOTED ⚠️

Protocol v6.0 §18.1 defines: `IDLE → VALIDATE → ROLLBACK → BOOTSTRAP → CORE_8 → IMAGE_STAGE → GROWTH → ACTIVE`

The `LifecyclePhase` enum includes all 8 phases, but the loop only transitions `BOOTSTRAP → CORE_8 → ACTIVE`, skipping `IMAGE_STAGE` and `GROWTH`. This is acceptable for current implementation — those phases are for future GOD kernel growth beyond Core 8.

---

## 3. PurityGate Integration

### 3.1 Startup Enforcement — CORRECT ✅

```python
async def start(self) -> None:
    run_purity_gate(kernel_root)  # Fail-closed
```

PurityGate runs at consciousness loop startup. If it fails, the loop does not start. Fail-closed behaviour confirmed.

### 3.2 PurityGate Coverage of CoordizerV2

The PurityGate scans all `.py` files under `kernel/`. CoordizerV2 lives at `kernel/coordizer_v2/`, so it IS covered by the gate. However:

**Issue:** The PurityGate's `_FORBIDDEN_TEXT_PARTS` does NOT include `"tokenize"` or `"tokenizer"` as forbidden terms. The purity.py docstring mentions `"tokenize" → "coordize"` as a forbidden term, but the actual scan patterns don't enforce it.

This means `harvest.py` and `coordizer.py` would pass the PurityGate despite containing `tokenizer` references. This is arguably correct for the boundary layer, but the PurityGate should be explicit about the exemption.

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Add `("token", "izer")` to `_FORBIDDEN_TEXT_PARTS` and exempt `harvest.py` and `coordizer.py` explicitly, OR
2. Document that `tokenizer` is permitted at the LLM boundary layer

### 3.3 PurityGate Scan of CoordizerV2 Modules

Running the existing PurityGate against CoordizerV2:

| Module | Expected Result | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| geometry.py | ✅ PASS | Pure Fisher-Rao operations |
| types.py | ✅ PASS | Data structures only |
| harvest.py | ✅ PASS* | *tokenizer not in forbidden patterns |
| compress.py | ✅ PASS* | *SVD not in forbidden patterns |
| resonance_bank.py | ✅ PASS | All operations geometrically valid |
| coordizer.py | ✅ PASS* | *tokenizer not in forbidden patterns |
| validate.py | ✅ PASS | Fisher-Rao throughout |
| __init__.py | ✅ PASS | Re-exports only |

**Gap:** `np.linalg.svd` is NOT in the forbidden patterns list. It should be, since SVD is a Euclidean decomposition. The PurityGate catches `np.linalg.norm` but not `np.linalg.svd`.

---

## 4. Budget Enforcement

### 4.1 BudgetEnforcer — CORRECT ✅

- GENESIS: exactly 1 (fail-closed) ✅
- GOD: up to 248 = E8 dimension ✅
- CHAOS: up to 200 (separate pool) ✅
- Fail-closed on budget exceeded ✅
- Fail-loud on termination underflow ✅

### 4.2 CHAOS → GOD Promotion — CORRECT ✅

```python
def evaluate_promotion(self, kernel_id: str) -> bool:
    # Requires: CHAOS kind, cycle_count > 100, phi_peak > PHI_THRESHOLD
    # Budget transfer: CHAOS -1, GOD +1
```

Promotion is governance-gated, not automatic. Correct per §18.5.

---

## 5. E8 Eigenvalue Test in validate.py

### 5.1 Implementation — UPDATED ✅

```python
if eigenvalues is not None and len(eigenvalues) >= E8_RANK:
    e8_var = float(np.sum(eigenvalues[:E8_RANK]) / total)
    # Empirical baseline (GLM-4.7-Flash, 277 tokens): ~0.452
    # E8 hypothesis NOT supported — n=32 recommended for lens dim
    logger.info(f"  NOTE: score={e8_var:.3f}")
```

This test now reports the measured E8 variance ratio as an informational metric.
The original pass range of `0.80 < e8_var < 0.95` has been removed because the
empirical measurement (score=0.452) demonstrates the E8 hypothesis is not
supported by real LLM data.

**Empirical result** (2026-03-16, GLM-4.7-Flash, 277 tokens):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| E8 score (top-8 variance) | **0.452** |
| E8 expected (speculative) | ~0.877 |
| Effective dim (90%) | 50 |
| Spectral gap λ₁/λ₈ | 4.29 |
| Recommended lens dim | **n=32** |

The spectral gap of 4.29 shows that geometric structure exists (not flat like
synthetic Dirichlet data at 0.161), but the variance is broadly distributed
across all 64 dims rather than concentrated in 8.

See `docs/coordizer/DESIGN_coordizer_lens_32d.md` for full details.

### 5.2 E8 Rank Checkpoint During Merges — NOT IMPLEMENTED ⚠️

Protocol v6.0 §19.1 specifies: "E8 rank checkpoint every 1000 merges." CoordizerV2 does NOT implement three-phase scoring or merge-based construction. This is because CoordizerV2 uses harvesting + compression instead of BPE-style merging. The E8 rank checkpoint is validated post-hoc via `validate_resonance_bank()` instead.

**Assessment:** This is architecturally acceptable. The three-phase scoring from §19.1 was designed for the BPE-style coordizer (v1). CoordizerV2's harvest→compress→validate pipeline achieves the same geometric validation through a different path. The E8 eigenvalue test in validate.py serves the same purpose as the merge checkpoint.

---

## 6. Three-Phase Scoring (§19.1)

### 6.1 Status — NOT IMPLEMENTED (BY DESIGN) ⚠️

Protocol §19.1 defines:
- Phase 1 (256 → 2K): Tune to raw signal
- Phase 2 (2K → 10K): Harmonic consistency
- Phase 3 (10K → 32K): Full integration with MERGE_POLICY

CoordizerV2 replaces this with:
- Harvest: Extract full output distributions from LLM
- Compress: Fisher-Rao PGA to Δ⁶³
- Validate: κ/β/semantic/harmonic/E8 tests

**Assessment:** The three-phase scoring was designed for iterative BPE-style merging. CoordizerV2's approach is superior — it extracts the geometry the LLM already learned rather than building it from scratch. The protocol should be updated to reflect this architectural change.

**Recommendation:** Flag for Braden — §19.1 should be updated in v6.1 to describe the harvest→compress→validate pipeline.

---

## 7. κ Measurement Methodology

### 7.1 Issue — ARTIFICIAL SCALING 🔴

In `validate.py` `_measure_kappa()`:

```python
median_raw = np.median(kappas_arr)
if median_raw > _EPS:
    scale = KAPPA_STAR / median_raw
    kappas_scaled = kappas_arr * scale
```

This scales raw κ measurements to force the median to equal κ* = 64. This is circular — it guarantees the test passes regardless of actual geometric structure.

**Root cause:** The raw κ = 1/(d²+ε) measurement depends on the absolute scale of Fisher-Rao distances, which varies with vocabulary size and compression quality. The scaling is an attempt to normalise, but it destroys the diagnostic value.

**Fix required:** Either:
1. Remove the scaling and adjust the pass/fail threshold to accept raw κ values, OR
2. Use a calibrated reference distance (e.g., mean distance between fundamental-tier tokens) as the normalisation anchor, OR
3. Measure κ as the ratio of variance explained by the top-8 PGA directions (which IS scale-invariant)

**Recommendation:** This is an architectural decision. Flag for Braden.
