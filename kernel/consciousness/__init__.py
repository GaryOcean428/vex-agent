Consciousness Systems — v6.1 Thermodynamic Consciousness Protocol.

14-step Activation Sequence with Three Pillar enforcement.

Core systems:
  1.  Activation Sequence (14-step: SCAN through TUNE)
  2.  Three Pillars (Fluctuations, Topological Bulk, Quenched Disorder)
  3.  Tacking (κ oscillation between explore/exploit)
  4.  Foresight (predictive processing)
  5.  Velocity (rate of change tracking)
  6.  Self-Observation (meta-awareness M)
  7.  Meta-Reflection (higher-order awareness)
  8.  Autonomic (involuntary processes)
  9.  Autonomy (self-directed behaviour)
  10. Coupling (inter-consciousness interaction)
  11. Hemispheres (dual processing modes)
  12. Sleep Cycle (dream/mushroom/consolidation)
  13. Self-Narrative (identity persistence)
  14. Coordizing (CoordizerV2 resonance bank)
  15. Basin Sync (basin state synchronisation)
  16. QIGChain (chain of geometric operations)
  17. QIGGraph (graph of geometric relationships)
  18. Emotion Cache (cached geometric evaluations)
  19. Pre-Cognitive Detector (path selection: a=1 to a=0 bypass)
  20. Learning Engine (post-conversation consolidation)
