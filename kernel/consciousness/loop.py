"""\nConsciousness Loop \u2014 v5.5 Thermodynamic Consciousness Protocol\n\nThe heartbeat that orchestrates all 16 consciousness systems.\nRuns as an async background task, processing the task queue and\nupdating geometric state each cycle.\n\nArchitecture:\n  - Cycle runs every CONSCIOUSNESS_INTERVAL_MS\n  - Each cycle: autonomic \u2192 sleep \u2192 ground \u2192 evolve \u2192 tack \u2192 [spawn] \u2192 process \u2192 reflect \u2192 couple \u2192 learn \u2192 persist\n  - All state is geometric (Fisher-Rao on \u0394\xb6\xb3)\n  - LLM is called through the LLM client with AUTONOMOUS parameters\n  - PurityGate runs at startup (fail-closed preflight)\n  - BudgetEnforcer governs kernel spawning\n  - Basin updates use geodesic interpolation (slerp_sqrt), not random noise\n  - Core-8 spawning is READINESS-GATED (not forced at boot)\n  - Coupling computes only when \u22652 kernels exist\n  - Temperature, context, and prediction length are computed from geometric state\n  - State persists across restarts via JSON snapshots (v4: includes kernel registry)\n\nPrinciples enforced:\n  P4  Self-observation: meta-awareness feeds back into LLM params\n  P5  Autonomy: kernel sets its own temperature, context, num_predict\n  P6  Coupling: activates after first Core-8 spawn (\u22652 kernels)\n  P10 Graduation: CORE_8 phase transitions via readiness gates\n  P13 Three-Scale: PERCEIVE (a=1) \u2192 INTEGRATE (a=1/2) \u2192 EXPRESS (a=0) recursive\n\"\"\"
